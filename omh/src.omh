$section Displaying Source Code$$

$head Syntax$$
$codei/@src%/filename/%@@
/$$
$codei/@src%/filename/%/indent/%/@@
/$$
$codei/@src%/filename/%/indent/%/start/%/stop/%@@

$codei/@src%/filename/%/indent/%/start/%/stop/%/skip/@@
/$$

$head See Also$$
$cref/getting started/start_src/$$,
$mref/codep/verbatim/$$

$head Purpose$$
This command will cause the specified
$cref/input file/glossary/Input File Searching/$$
to be displayed as program source code with highlighting.

$head Delimiter Sequence$$
The $cref codep$$ and $cref verbatim$$ provide others ways
that source code can be displayed.
$codei/

%/filename/%/indent/%/start/%/stop/%/skip/@@
/$$
is a $cref/delimiter sequence/glossary/Delimiter Sequence/$$
where $code %$$ can be any character that is not a letter.

$head filename$$
The value of $icode filename$$ specifies the name
of the file that is displayed.
Leading and trailing white space in $icode filename$$ is ignored.

$head indent$$
If $icode indent$$ is present,
it is a positive integer and specifies
the number of spaces to indent the output.

$subhead Example$$
The following command
$codep
	@src%../src/highlight.h%4%@@
$$
displays the entire file $code highlight.h$$,
with a four space indentation as follows:
$src%../src/highlight.h%4%$$
Note that a newline was automatically added at the beginning of the file.

$head start$$
If $icode start$$ is present,
it specifies a sequence of characters after which output should start.
In this case none of the characters in the file before,
and including,
this starting sequence are displayed.

$subhead escape$$
If the $cref escape$$ character is present in $icode start$$,
there must be three decimal digits following it.
In this case the escape character together with the three following
characters, represent the single character with ascii code equal
to the decimal value of the three decimal digits.

$head stop$$
If $icode start$$ is present, $icode stop$$ must also be present.
It specifies
a sequence of characters just before which output should stop.
In this case none of the characters in the file following,
and including,
this stopping sequences are displayed.

$subhead escape$$
If the $cref escape$$ character is present in $icode stop$$,
there must be three decimal digits following it.
In this case the escape character together with the three following
characters, represent the single character with ascii code equal
to the decimal value of the three decimal digits.

$subhead Example$$
The following command sequence
$codep
	@src%../src/highlight.h%4%// BEGIN PROTOTYPE%// END PROTOTYPE%@@
$$
displays the following output:
$src%../src/highlight.h%4%// BEGIN PROTOTYPE%// END PROTOTYPE%$$
Note that the newline after $code // BEGIN PROOTYPE$$,
and the newline before $code // END PROTOTYPE$$,
are included in the output

$head skip$$
If $icode skip$$ is present,
it is a positive integer that specifies the number of
$icode start$$ matches to skip.
This is very useful when the $code @src$$ command
refers to the same file as the command is in.
The skip option can be used to skip the match on the command
and go forward to the location that you wish to display.

$head Tab Stops$$
The $cref tabsize$$ command
enables you to match the indentation of the $code src$$ command
with one of the tabbing columns.
