$head Description$$
The backslash, $code \$$, is the default escape character.
This command changes the escape character to the first character in
$italic character$$ (not counting leading
$xref/glossary/White Space/white space/$$).

$head Example$$
If you want to display a backslash in $mref/math/$$ mode, it is useful
to change the current escape character from its default value (backslash).
For example, the input
$codep
	@escape #@@
	@math%
		#Test #of #escape:
		    / 1  0  0 \
		I = | 0  1  0 |
		    \ 0  0  1 /
	%@@
$$
would result in the following output
$escape #$$
$math%
	#Test #of #escape:
	    / 1  0  0 \
	I = | 0  1  0 |
	    \ 0  0  1 /
%$$

$head Reference$$
The $code escape$$ command has effect till the next such command
is executed or the end of the current section (which ever comes first).
