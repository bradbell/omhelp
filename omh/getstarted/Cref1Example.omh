$section Parent Section For Cross Referencing Examples$$

$head First Argument$$
The first argument to a cref command is the text
that the user sees for the link.
This is also the default value for the cross reference tag of the 
section that we are linking to.
Each section starts with a begin command 
that contains its cross reference tag as an argument.
The cross reference tag for this section is Cref1Example.
The cross reference tags for the children of this section are
$cref/_contents/$$,
$cref/Cref2Example/$$,
$cref/Cref3Example/$$,
$cref/_reference/$$,
$cref/_index/$$, or
$cref/_search/$$.
Note that the sections corresponding to
_contents,
_reference,
_index,
and _search,
are automatically generated.
