$head Introduction$$
The $xref/begin/$$ command starts a new section
and the $code @end$$ command ends the current section.
An OMhelp section is defined
as the content between a $code @begin$$ and $code @end$$ command.
The argument to a  
$xref/section/$$ command specifies the title
for the current section.

$head Execute The Following Steps$$

$subhead Install$$
The first step is to
$xref/install/$$ OMhelp on your system.
Then you can run any of the following examples:

$subhead Omh Directory$$
Create an empty directory with a name of your choosing
that we will refer to as $italic omh$$ below.

$subhead SimpleExample.omh$$
Use the editor of your choice to
create the file $syntax%%omh%\SimpleExample.omh%$$ 
with the following contents:
$code
$pre
     $$@begin $verbatim%SimpleExample.omh%5%#036begin %$$
$$
Note that you can copy and paste the commands above
into your editor window.
You may just copy the file with the same name from the 
$xref/getstarted/Getting Started Directory/getting started directory/$$.

$subhead Example In This Web Site Context$$
You can view the
result of making $code SimpleExample.omh$$
part of the OMhelp help web site 
by selecting 
$xref/SimpleExample/$$.

$subhead Htm Directory$$
Create the directory $syntax%%omh%\htm%$$.

$subhead Execute OMhelp$$
In a Dos window and in the directory $syntax%%omh%\htm%$$,
execute the following command
$codep
	omhelp ..\SimpleExample.omh
$$

$subhead Example by Itself$$
If you use a web browser of your choosing to view the file
$syntax%%omh%\htm\simpleexample.htm%$$,
$pre
	$$
$code $title SimpleExample$$$$
$pre
$$
is displayed as the title of the web page
(and that is all that is displayed).


$head Files$$
$list number$$
The file
$code simpleexample.htm$$
contains a definition of the frames for this web page
(and there is only one frame).
$lnext
The file $code simpleexample_frame1.htm$$
contains the actual output that you see.
$lnext The file 
$xref/running/Output File Names/index.htm/$$ 
is an automatically generated copy of 
$code simpleexample$$.
$lend

$end
