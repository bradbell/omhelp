$section Embedding OMhelp Commands in Source Code$$
$index source code, embed in$$
$index embed in, source code$$

$head Introduction$$
OMhelp is designed to be embedded in computer source code.
In fact, it is language independent and can be can combine source
code files in multiple languages to form one documentation system.
Only the text between a $code @begin$$ and a $code @end$$ is processed
by OMhelp.
It is intended that these commands be comments in the language.


$head A Language with Block Structured Comments$$
This example covers all languages that have block structured comments; e.g.,
C, C++, Java, Python.
$index C, omhelp example$$
$index C++, omhelp example$$
$index Java, omhelp example$$
$index Python, omhelp example$$

$subhead Factorial.c$$
Use an editor of your choice to
create the file $code Factorial.c$$ 
in the 
$xref/
	start_simple/
	Execute The Following Steps.Test Directory/
	test directory/$$
the contents of which can be seen by selecting 
$cref/view_factorial.c/$$.
Note that you can copy and paste the contents of
$code Factorial.c$$ to your editor window.
You may just copy the file $code Factorial.c$$ from the 
$xref/getstarted/Getting Started Directory/getting started directory/$$.

$subhead Example In This Web Site Context$$
You can view the
result of making $code Factorial.c$$
part of the OMhelp help web site 
by selecting 
$xref/Factorial.c/$$.

$subhead Execute OMhelp$$
In a command window and 
in the 
$xref/
	start_simple/
	Execute The Following Steps.Htm Directory/
	htm directory/$$
execute the following command
$codep
	omhelp ../ Factorial.c -noframe
$$


$subhead Example by Itself$$
Use a web browser of your choosing to view the file
$syntax%%test%/htm/factorial.c.htm%$$.


$head A Language with only One Line Comments$$
This example covers languages that only have one line comments; e.g.,
Matlab, Fortran, R.
(The R language uses the @ character, this it may be necessary to change
the OMhelp $cref/KeyCharacter/$$.)
$index Matlab, omhelp example$$
$index Fortran, omhelp example$$
$index R, omhelp example$$

$subhead Factorial.m$$
Use an editor of your choice to
create the file $code Factorial.m$$ 
in the 
$xref/
	start_simple/
	Execute The Following Steps.Test Directory/
	test directory/$$
the contents of which can be seen by selecting 
$cref/view_factorial.m/$$.
Note that you can copy and paste the contents of
$code Factorial.m$$ to your editor window.
You may just copy the file $code Factorial.m$$ from the 
$xref/getstarted/Getting Started Directory/getting started directory/$$.

$subhead Example In This Web Site Context$$
You can view the
result of making $code Factorial.m$$
part of the OMhelp help web site 
by selecting 
$xref/Factorial.m/$$.

$subhead Execute OMhelp$$
In a command window and 
in the 
$xref/
	start_simple/
	Execute The Following Steps.Htm Directory/
	htm directory/$$
execute the following command
$codep
	omhelp ../ Factorial.m -noframe
$$


$subhead Example by Itself$$
Use a web browser of your choosing to view the file
$syntax%%test%/htm/factorial.m.htm%$$.
