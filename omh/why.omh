$head Introduction$$
OMhelp was originally created to reduce the time and effort required
to document the
$href%http://www.omatrix.com/manual/%O-Matrix%$$ computer language.
The CppAD
$href%http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/Doc/cppad.htm%CppAD%$$
is a better demonstration of what OMhelp can do.
Brad Bell's
$href%http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell%home page%$$
is also written in OMhelp.

$head Same Time Documentation$$
Make documentation changes and additions at the same time as the source
code changes. This reduces the total amount of work because the changes
and additions to the system are fresh in ones mind when the documentation
is modified.
In addition, the other people on the project immediately have
a specification
(for the changes and additions)
that is separate from the actual code.

$head Version Control$$
Use the same version control system
that tracks changes to the source code to track
changes to the documentation; see
$href%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control%version control%$$.
This makes it easy and natural to make the documentation changes
at the same time as the source code changes.
In addition,
the developer edits OMhelp commands directly
instead of through a visual editor that displays what the user will see.
This reduces the source changes between versions and makes them
more meaningful to the developer.

$head Language Independent and User Oriented$$
OMhelp can extract documentation from source code comments of the system that
is written in multiple languages.
This makes it easier to accomplish the objectives listed above.
In addition,
embedding the documentation in the source code
(in a language independent way)
requires the developer to think about the changes from the users
point of view.
The
$href%http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/%doxygen%$$
system is similar with the following exceptions:

$list number$$
Doxygen only works for systems in one language.
$lnext
Doxygen generates documentation from a developer (not user) point of view;
i.e., it exposes implementation details.
$lend

When the users are developer and only one language is being used,
Doxygen has the advantage of
automatically providing language specific
aids to the documentation.

$head World Wide Web$$
OMhelp can create both HTML and XML representations for
display by browsers.
This provides a means, with no extra work,
by which the complete documentation
can be searched for and viewed on the World Wide Web.
For example, the complete documentation for OMhelp can be viewed at
$pre
	$$
$href%http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell/omhelp%$$

$head Single Source$$
Many of the OMhelp features come from a single source philosophy.
It is easy to create examples that are both source code and documentation.
There is provision for jump tables such that if the destination text changes
the source text changes automatically.
A $cref/printable/running/printable/$$
version of the web site can be generated with all the cross reference
links included and numbered so they are fully functional.

$head Searching$$
OMhelp makes it easy to provide the
user of the corresponding help system with the means of finding things quickly.
For example, entries in the keyword
$cref/index/_index/$$ are also used by the OMhelp
$cref/search/_search/$$ utility.
In addition, all the keywords are posted in meta commands that
aid Web search engines in finding the corresponding documentation.
Furthermore, a jump table for each section called
$cref/reference/_reference/$$ table,
a list of $cref/external/_external/$$ links,
and a table of
$cref/contents/_contents/$$
are automatically provided.

$head Cross Referencing Aids$$
All of the internal
$cref cross$$ references are checked when OMhelp is run.
This informs one immediately when
the help system changes in a way that breaks a cross reference
(thus changes that have this effect are easier to make).
In addition, it is possible to list all of the external cross reference
links and where they occur in the help system.
This makes it easy to check links that depend on things outside of the
help system and that there usage within the help system is still correct.

$head Platform Independent$$
OMhelp will run under Microsoft Windows, Mac, or any Unix Operating system.

$head Latex Support of Mathematics$$
OMhelp supports Latex commands which it converts
to MathML ($icode%*%.xml%$$) or MathJax ($codei%*%.htm%$$)
for display by a browser.
This is far superior to using pictures to display mathematics.

$head Source Code Examples$$
OMhelp has may options for including source code that also runs.
This include some source code highlighting commands.
It also makes it easy to keep the examples up to date with
changes to a system (when the examples are also automated tests).

$head Spell Checking$$
OMhelp provides a $cref spell$$ command that lists spelling exceptions
for a particular section.
This relieves the user from having to
allow the same spelling exception multiple times.
